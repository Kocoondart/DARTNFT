# DARTNFT
Solana NFT Project

Executive Summary
 
Kocoon d’Art is a startup founded in 2018, specialising in art gallery and exhibition organisation, private and corporate curation as well as art consulting. Project d’Art NFT is a new business venture started in 2021 to create a physical art NFT and DeFi services platform based on the technology of Solana. 

Project d’Art NFT’s mission is to disrupt the traditional art industry, democratising the Arts by registering world-class art works to NFTs on-chain, while providing financial services including lending/borrowing, asset management, derivatives and payments. 

Our vision is to make the Arts, the greatest wealth of mankind, accessible to everyone to own and invest, fostering diversity in the types of art owners and collectors. We will work until every established and promising young artist has their real-world art registered as an NFT and offered an access to a global audience, as never before. 
 
Art is difficult for the general public to access due to high social and economic entry barriers. In particular, expensive works of art are perceived by society as the exclusive property of a few wealthy people. Better trading systems and technological innovations are needed to ensure equal access to art and NFT technology is making this possible. Registering real-world artwork as NFTs simplifies trading by getting rid of the traditional art industry gatekeepers, enhances availability and guarantees transparency. In doing so, opaque art transactions and unnecessary rise in prices creating high entry barriers for both artists and art collectors are eliminated, revitalising the art industry.
 
Our team at Kocoon d’Art has identified a large, profitable and growing market which can be illustrated by not only noteworthy banks which have ventured into the virtual asset business but also the trends of institutional investors and the impressive market growth figures in the crypto and art industry. For example, the DeFi sector currently represents only 0.1% of its maximum potential, and is expected to grow 100 times in the next 5 years. The general public are looking to diversify their portfolios in times of heightened uncertainty, maturing technology and new business models and we see that art has become even more interesting as an alternative asset class. 
 
Now, we are preparing to build on our momentum, expecting to move our headquarters to Switzerland in April 2022 and seeking seed series funding to support the development of our prototype, executing our strategic marketing plan and outreach initiatives in the form of art experiences, exhibitions and more. Our current efforts are all geared towards launching full-scale production and distribution of Kocoon digital products, and securing our company’s position as an undisputed leader in the NFT and digitalisation of the Arts.
